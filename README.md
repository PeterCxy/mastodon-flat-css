# Tweaks included
This theme applies a few colors, but leaves the class names mostly ungrouped so that you can experiment for yourself if you wish to modify this theme with your own color choices. The only elements that are grouped are the ones that comprise the column headers (.column-header, .column-header__button, .column-back-button, .column-header__back-button), to maintain a consistent header color. Additionally, the detailed toot view is linked (.detailed-status, .detailed-status__action-bar) so that the action buttons have the same background as the toot itself.

This theme also removes borders for a flat look, as well as replaces the font on most text elements. Finally, it forces the full display name and account handle to be shown, and on separate lines.
